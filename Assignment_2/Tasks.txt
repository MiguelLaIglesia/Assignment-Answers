IMPORTANTEE: BONUS MARKS (to get +2 score) if you create a ‘uso-general’ annotation object that can hold any kind of functional annotation

TASKS:  

    -Create an “InteractionNetwork” Object to contain the members of each network

    -Annotate it with any KEGG Pathways the interaction network members are part of

        both KEGG ID and Pathway Name

    -Annotate it with the GO Terms associated with the total of all genes in the network

        Limit these annotations to the biological process part of the GO Ontology!

        Both GO:ID and GO Term Name

    *Create a report of which members of the gene list are involved in shared networks, and report the KEGG/GO functional annotations of those networks.
